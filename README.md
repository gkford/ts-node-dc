# GPT integrated single page app

monorepo for creating a GPT integrated single page app 
- with api ts-node and express
- single page frontend in react
- auth0 for oauth

## Notes

In the Auth0 dashboard you will need to create three distinct apps:

1. api
2. Single page application for the react frontend
3. Machine to Machine application for connecting to GPT (although, the application will connect via proxy auth and token paths given in the api)

## Single page application setup:



## What to put in the GPT thingo



## What to do with the callback

- Have to exit the GPT screen and copy paste the callback into auth0

## Open API spec

- No way of generating this at the moment - recommend using LLM to generate it, though apparently tools exist
